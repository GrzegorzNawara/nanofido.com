<h4>Introduction</h4>
After a series of earthquakes, Sparta is going through very difficult times.
Starvation and state weakness cause anger and sadness.
Rebellion in the cities could lead to the fall of Sparta.
All that can save Sparta is us - a handful of fearless heroes.
</i>

<h4>Rules Summary</h4>
1. All cities are in danger of rebellion. If they are not saved, they will be destroyed.
2. There are 12 heroes in each tribe that we can control.
3. Each city needs some goods. To save a city, you need to deliver almost all the goods to the city. One need may remain unmet.
4. If the needs are not met in time - the city will be destroyed.
5. If the needs are met - the city is saved.
6. Each hero can find and collect goods. The hero continues collecting even when no one controls him.
7. The hero's shield is magical - the symbols placed on it allow you to travel between cities and between heroes. Because of the ancient curse, symbols can be remembered but not written down.
8. Tablets allow the hero to quickly reach the selected city.
9. The shield takes us to a new hero.
10. On the map, hero can meet rebel leaders of different levels. The hero defeats the encountered rebel leaders of a lower level.
11. We are to save as many Sparta citizens and capture as many rebel leaders as possible. The simulation ends when there are no more cities to save.

<h4>Cities</h4>
There are 15 cities in random locations on the map.
Each city has between 1,000 and 9,000 inhabitants.
In total, 70,000 inhabitants live in all the cities.
Each city needs 1 to 3 different goods.
The heroes have to find goods on the map, collect them and deliver them to the city.
Each city also has a clock for the impending rebellion.
The clock becomes visible 15 minutes before the outbreak of the rebellion.

<h4>Saved cities</h4>
To save a city, you need to deliver almost all the goods it needs.
One good type may remain undelivered.
The saved city is safe - it will never be affected by a rebellion again.
Icon of the city is changing to a "big city".

<h4>Ruins</h4>
A rebellion breaks out in a city that is not saved in time.
The city is irretrievably destroyed.
The city icon now shows city ruins.
News of the rebellion spread throughout Sparta.
All cities larger than the destroyed city reduce their Rebel Timers by 5 minutes.

<h4>Rebels</h4>
Rebel leaders at levels 1-30 are located on the map.
There is only one rebel leader of each level.
The hero defeats the rebel leaders of a lower level.
The defeated rebel leaders are captured and provide additional goods.
For captured rebel leaders, we get as many points as the lowest level of the un captured rebel leader is.

<h4>Tablets</h4>
Each plate has the name of the city and a code consisting of three symbols.
After clicking on the hero's shield (the right hero's panel), a window for selecting symbols will appear.
Selecting the symbols in the correct order will move the hero to the indicated city.
For the best workshop experience, please do not write down the codes.

<h4>Hero shields</h4>
We control 12 heroes together.
After clicking on the hero's shield (the right hero's panel), a window for selecting symbols will appear.
Selecting a new hero's shield will transfer control to the new hero.
Each hero can only be controlled by one person at a time.
When transferring control from hero A to B, the person controlling hero B will be transferred to A.

<h4>Map</h4>
A paper, one-time map of Sparta helps you see the situation and mark the resources and leaders of the rebels.
